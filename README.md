**batteryMizer
team cyber ciphers' entry for taqneeq hackathon- cyber cypher**

**overview** :
to maximize battery health of an ev so as to extend its maxinmum capacity so that in the log run an individual will not have ot have them replaced sooner and eventually making it more cost effective over a goven period of time. 
this program was writtem in python and graphics using turtle 


**detailed** :
our main aim is to maximize battery health of an ev so as to extend its maxinmum capacity so that in the log run an individual will not have ot have them replaced sooner and eventually making it more cost effective over a goven period of time. 
batteries have a specific range of percentages between which their performance have minimal effect over the health (reasons might include thermal degradation etc)
this safe range of battery percentage to optimize health is 50%-80%
we have taken a model car - the tata nexon which gives 312km/full charge 
since the distance travelled vs energy required is not linear, we calculated 100km of distance in that range

**logic**:
a safe distance (charging stations placed randomly were sometimes not in the range) of 150km was assumed
the goal of the programme is to chart a path from point A to point B so that so that every charging station is within 150 km but maximum too so that driver doesnt have to stop after very short intervals to charge 
theyll be asked to stop charging the ev till 80% at every charging station so that by the time they reach the next station, theyll be around the 50%mark
